The article states that, whether in science or business, we "don't have to settle for models at all.
" Do you agree or disagree with this statement? How? And why? Certainly feel free to articulate a more nuanced or hybrid view, if you'd like.

    In my opinion, I agree that is it not necessary to build a model when there are plenty of data. That is, building the model is trying to input some assumption data then find the result, to prove something. However, when there are enough data for scientist to do the analysis and find the result to prove something they want to prove, it is not necessary anymore that scientist need to build a model as they did before. It's also the same for the business, when business man are trying to find out why did people like something, they don't have to build the model and test it again and again. They just need to use the data they already have and do the analysis. That's why I agree to the statement and it's not necessary to settle a model when there are enough data.
