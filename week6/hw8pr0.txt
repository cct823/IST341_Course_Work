I think computer will become smarter based on the algorithm. Google build the model and then when user are using it, they will trigger the condition, so Google can push the ads to target customers. When user keep searching on the internet, Google will keep pushing the ads that related to user's search result. For me, it's kinda annoying and I will worry about my privacy, because everything what I want to look for Google knows. It may be dangerous. However, sometime is useful because technology still comes from humanity. That is, people can click on the ads or promotion show on the page that people might want. I won't say it's good or bad, but people do need to be careful with this.
