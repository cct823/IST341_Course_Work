For me, I think the most interesting idea in this article to me is that the machine is getting smarter than human beings.
With building a database and generate a program, people can make computer memorize more things than human does, so when needed, computer can search through the database and find the result. I think this could use in machine learning in the future. That is, human build the model for computer and computer can learn through model and make the prediction.
I think Watson-style and human-style thinking is really different, Watson-style thinking is looking into Database, it doesn't include any realistic feelings that human will have. It is a machine only generate 0 and 1 which is True and False, every question Waston-style thinking will come up with a closest question if the data isn't build up in database. However, with the answer of a question is not 0 or 1, I think the human-style thinking can not be replaced by Waston-style thinking because Waston-style thinking will not have these answer stored but human can think through past experiences. I think this is the biggest different between two thinking.
