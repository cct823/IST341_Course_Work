First, an A.I. system must be subject to the full gamut of laws that apply to its human operator. I agree to this one because machine sometimes can do better than human does, so if the A.I. doesn't follow the rules, it could be easy for A.I. to break the law and harm the human. Hence, I agree this is really important rule and should be followed by everyone.
